# slot-machine

"A simple Java slot machine game with betting and randomized spins."

okay so, this was an interesting project
This project formed part of me completing the Bro Code Java Course:

okay so, i completed this project while only viewing his output, so it may not be exactly the same
nonethless, i'm not particularly a fan of his teaching style...not gonna dive too deep

uhm, this project has no error handling in terms of a user entering the wrong input at certain points
that's because i haven't learned a try and catch code yet

overall, awesome project had fun building it
